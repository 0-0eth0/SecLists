SecLists is a collection of multiple types and versions of security lists, including usernames, passwords, sensitive data grep strings, fuzzing payloads, etc. The idea is to have all these in a single place so that when it comes time to break something you can simply pull a copy of the git repository and be on your way.

If you have any ideas for things we should include, please send them to daniel@danielmiessler.com. Also note that any lists that have been painsteakingly assembled by someone else will only be used with permission of the creator.

This project is maintained by Daniel Miessler and Jason Haddix.
